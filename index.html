    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <h3>Thanks for stopping by.</h3>
    <p>My name is Aileen, and I am a third-year Data Science and Economics major at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

    <p>At Berkeley, I am a behavioural economics and economic inequality researcher in the <a href="https://learnmoore.org/">Moore Accuracy Lab</a> and an Equity in Energy and Environmental Economics Research Fellow in the <a href="https://www.olab.berkeley.edu/energyinstitute-sloan">UC Berkeley Opportunity Lab and Energy Institute at Haas</a>, where I am using machine learning to determine optimal locations for future air pollution monitors in regulating pollution.</p>

    <p>Beyond research, I am on teaching staff for <a href="https://www.data8.org/fa23/">Data 8</a>, UC Berkeley's foundational data science course. I have the pleasure of teaching two weekly sections with five students each, providing concept reviews and guiding them through practice problems in coding and statistics. Previously, I was a teaching assistant for <a href="https://www.stat20.org/">Stat 20</a>, an equivalent introductory statistics and probability class that teaches R instead of Python.</p>

    <p>Outside of school and work, I have a deep appreciation for nature, and I love to spend whatever free time I have immersed in it. I love to snowboard and have competed at the <a href="https://www.uscsa.org/">collegiate level</a>. When there's no snow, I hike, climb, and go camping.</p>
